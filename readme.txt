In an overall, this project aims to develop a crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms to assist farmers in selecting suitable crops for cultivation based on various environmental factors and agricultural parameters. By analyzing historical data on climate conditions, soil properties, crop yields, and other relevant variables, the system will generate personalized recommendations to maximize agricultural productivity and sustainability.
